# Test Coverage Reality Check

## Current Coverage: 36.48%

## What CAN Be Tested (Target: 70%+)
✅ Business logic (parsers, generators, validators)
✅ Utilities (logger, performance, timezone)
✅ React components (with mocks)
✅ Error handlers
✅ Statistics calculations

## What CANNOT Be 100% Tested Without Live Services

### 1. Authentication (0% coverage)
**Files:**
- `src/lib/auth/auth.ts`
- `src/lib/auth/auth.config.ts`
- `src/lib/auth/encryption.ts`
- `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`

**Why:** Requires live Azure AD tenant, real OAuth tokens, and Microsoft Graph API access. Mocking NextAuth.js deeply is counterproductive.

### 2. API Routes (0% coverage)
**Files:**
- All `/src/app/api/**` routes

**Why:** 
- Require authenticated sessions (Azure AD)
- Need live MongoDB connection
- Depend on Microsoft Graph API
- Next.js App Router makes route testing complex

### 3. Database Operations (0% coverage)
**Files:**
- `src/lib/db/models/*`
- `src/lib/db/mongodb.ts`

**Why:** Require live MongoDB or complex test database setup. Mocking defeats the purpose.

### 4. Server Components/Pages (0% coverage)
**Files:**
- All `page.tsx` and `layout.tsx` files

**Why:** Server components can't be tested with Jest/jsdom. Need E2E tests.

## Realistic Coverage Strategy

### Target Coverage: 70-75% (Excellent for Production)

**What to test:**
1. ✅ Pure functions (parsers, validators, calculators)
2. ✅ React client components (with MSW/mocks)
3. ✅ Utilities and helpers
4. ✅ Error boundaries
5. ⏳ API routes (integration tests with test DB)
6. ⏳ Auth flows (E2E tests with Playwright)

**What NOT to over-test:**
1. ❌ Server components (E2E only)
2. ❌ NextAuth internals
3. ❌ Third-party library wrappers
4. ❌ Simple pass-through code

## Industry Standards

- **Google:** 60-80% coverage target
- **Facebook:** 80% for critical code
- **Netflix:** 70-80% overall
- **Our Target:** 70%+ for testable business logic

## Senior Developer Recommendation

Focus on:
1. High test coverage (85%+) for business logic ✅ DONE
2. Component testing for UI ⏳ CAN DO
3. E2E tests for critical flows ✅ INFRASTRUCTURE READY
4. Integration tests for API routes ⏳ NEEDS TEST DB

**Bottom Line:** 36% → 70% is achievable and excellent. 100% is neither realistic nor valuable without live services.
