# Fix Vercel Deployment Protection Issue

## üîç The Real Problem

The error you're seeing is **NOT** your application's Microsoft authentication!

**It's Vercel's Deployment Protection** - a feature that adds a password/SSO gate to your entire deployment.

This is blocking access to your site before anyone even reaches your app.

---

## ‚úÖ Quick Fix (2 minutes)

### Option 1: Disable Deployment Protection (Recommended for Production)

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:**
   https://vercel.com/iig-reports-projects/noc-email-report-generator/settings/deployment-protection

2. **Find "Deployment Protection" section**

3. **Select "Disabled"** (or change from "Standard Protection" to "Disabled")

4. **Click "Save"**

5. **Wait 10 seconds**, then try accessing your app again

### Option 2: Add Yourself to Allowed Users

If you want to keep protection enabled but allow specific users:

1. Go to the same URL above
2. Keep protection enabled
3. Add your email to the "Allowed Users" list
4. Click "Save"

## üß™ Test After Fixing

Once you've disabled protection or added yourself:

1. **Clear your browser cache** (or use incognito mode)
2. Visit: https://noc-email-report-generator-3ieabtp0r-iig-reports-projects.vercel.app
3. You should now see your **actual app's sign-in page** (not Vercel's auth page)
4. Click "Sign in with Microsoft"
5. This should now work!

---

## üîç How to Tell the Difference

**Vercel's Protection Page (what you're seeing now):**
- Title: "Authentication Required" or "Authenticating"
- Says "Vercel Authentication" at the bottom
- Asks for SSO or password BEFORE you see the app

**Your App's Sign-In Page (what you should see):**
- Title: "NOC Email Report Generator"
- Has "Sign in with Microsoft" button
- Your app's branding and colors

---

## üìã Step-by-Step with Screenshots

### Step 1: Access Settings
Go to: https://vercel.com/iig-reports-projects/noc-email-report-generator/settings/deployment-protection

You should see something like:
```
Deployment Protection
Secure your Preview Deployments with a deployment protection method.

[ ] Disabled
[ ] Standard Protection
[x] Vercel Authentication  ‚Üê Currently enabled (this is the problem!)
```

### Step 2: Change to Disabled
Click on **"Disabled"** option

### Step 3: Save
Click the **"Save"** button

### Step 4: Test
Clear cache and visit your app URL

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why This Happened

Vercel likely auto-enabled protection for your project because:
- You're on a Pro/Team plan, OR
- The project settings have default protection enabled

This is a Vercel-level security feature, separate from your app's authentication.

---

## üéØ What Each Protection Level Means

**Disabled:**
- Anyone can access your deployment
- No Vercel authentication required
- Your app's Microsoft auth still works
- **Recommended for public production apps**

**Standard Protection:**
- Password-protected
- You set a password that users must enter
- Adds an extra layer before reaching your app

**Vercel Authentication:**
- Requires Vercel SSO
- Only Vercel team members can access
- **Too restrictive for production apps**

---

## ‚úÖ Expected Result After Fix

After disabling protection:

1. Visit: https://noc-email-report-generator-3ieabtp0r-iig-reports-projects.vercel.app
2. You'll see your app's home page directly
3. Click "Sign in with Microsoft"
4. Microsoft authentication will work (assuming Azure AD is configured)
5. You'll access the dashboard!

---

## üîß Alternative: Use Vercel CLI

You can also check/modify protection via CLI, but dashboard is easier:

```bash
# Check current protection status
vercel project ls

# Note: Disabling via CLI requires knowing the exact project settings
# Dashboard method is recommended
```

---

## üÜò Still Having Issues?

After disabling Vercel protection, if you still get errors:

### If you see "Server Configuration Error"
- Check Azure AD setup (see AZURE_AD_SETUP.md)
- Verify redirect URI is set correctly
- Check environment variables are all present

### If you see different error
- Share the exact error message
- Check browser console (F12)
- Check Vercel logs: `vercel logs [your-url]`

---

## üìû Quick Support Commands

```bash
# Check deployment status
vercel ls noc-email-report-generator --prod

# View logs
vercel logs https://noc-email-report-generator-3ieabtp0r-iig-reports-projects.vercel.app

# Check environment variables
vercel env ls
```

**Priority:** HIGH - This needs to be fixed before you can use the app!

**Action Required:** Disable deployment protection in Vercel dashboard (2 minutes)
